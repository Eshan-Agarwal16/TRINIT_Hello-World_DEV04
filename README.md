<h3>Introduction</h3>
CCTVs have been around for over 20 years. Traditionally security agents and operations managers have been tasked with real-time CCTV camera monitoring to detect abnormal behaviour or situations in areas under surveillance or for post-event investigation. They have needed to review hours or days of footage to extract evidence and understand what occurred at the time of the incident. Due to time constraints, it is difficult to catch on all the relevant data required to solve the issue. Also, humans are prone to errors making it more difficult to efficiently process the data. The aim of this project is to build a system for the CCTV industry that independently identifies human faces, generates alerts and gathers evidence of the incident.
