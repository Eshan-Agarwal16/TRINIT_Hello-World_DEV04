<h3>Introduction</h3>
CCTVs have been around for over 20 years. Traditionally security agents and operations managers have been tasked with real-time CCTV camera monitoring to detect abnormal behaviour or situations in areas under surveillance or for post-event investigation. They have needed to review hours or days of footage to extract evidence and understand what occurred at the time of the incident. Due to time constraints, it is difficult to catch on all the relevant data required to solve the issue. Also, humans are prone to errors making it more difficult to efficiently process the data. The aim of this project is to build a system for the CCTV industry that independently identifies human faces, generates alerts and gathers evidence of the incident.

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<li>The authorised user is supposed to login via the GUI interface. </li>
<li>The CCTV is activated once the user logs in and the cctv starts recording.<> 
<li>The CCTV now detects the motion.</li>
<li>If there is movement detected the is an immediate alert by a chime.</li>
<li>The video is then recorded.</li> 
<li>The recorded video is sent to the cloud storage here the drive.</li> 
<li>The CCTV also recognises a face and sends an email of best possible picture of the face detected.</li> 
<li>The CCTV also sends an immediate email alert once motion is detected. </li>
